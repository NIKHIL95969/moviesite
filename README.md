## About Project

I developed a dynamic website using React that fetches data from an API and displays it on the site. The website incorporates React Router for seamless navigation between different pages and utilizes Material UI components for a polished and modern user interface. The final version of the website was deployed on Vercel to make it easily accessible.

This project showcased my skills in frontend development, specifically in React, API integration, and UI design. By utilizing React's component-based architecture, I created reusable components to efficiently fetch and display data from the API. The React Router implementation ensured smooth navigation and a seamless user experience.

To enhance the visual appeal and usability of the website, I incorporated Material UI components. These components provided a consistent design language and a responsive layout, resulting in an intuitive and engaging user interface.

After completing the development phase, I deployed the website on Vercel, a reliable hosting platform for frontend projects. This allowed me to showcase the live version of the website, making it easily accessible to potential users and employers. The deployment process demonstrated my proficiency in deploying React applications and making them publicly available.
